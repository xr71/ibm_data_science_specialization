## CRISP-DM
Increasing the use of Data Mining over industries and business applications.  
Six step process for increasing likelihood of ds projects:  
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment 

### Importance of Questions
Seek clarification to obtain business understanding. Getting clarity in order to drive the data needed and the approach to address the question.  

### Analytic Approach
* Descriptive
* Diagnostic
* Predictive / Forecasting
* Prescriptive 

### Data Requirements and Collection
Available data sources  
External data sources  
Data wanted but not available  
It is alright to defer decisions later when more data is available  
Extracted data and merging, removing redundant data  
Remember here: the content and format of our data representation matter and are important to keep in mind   
It is also important to anticipate future needs of data in the process as well  


### Understanding to Preparation
Data Quality:
* Missing values
* Invalid values   

It is important to question whether these missing or invalid values actually mean anything  
Keep in mind that you need to take an iterative approach here and refine your understanding of the data  

Data Transformation:  
Clean, reformat, and feature engineer  
Text analysis - encoding  
Aggregate to the right level of detail  
May be necessary to conduct a literature review at this stage  


### From Modeling to Evaluation  
Modeling:  
* Descriptive
* Predictive   
Using training and testing sets to evaluate these models
